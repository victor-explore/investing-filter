## Introduction

In India, room measurements are typically expressed in feet (ft). One foot is approximately equal to the length of an adult human foot (about 30.48 centimeters or 12 inches). This unit of measurement has historical roots and remains the standard for real estate and construction in India despite the country's official adoption of the metric system.
